# Student_Performance_Predictor
This repository contains a project focused on predicting student performance using multiple linear regression. The goal is to analyze various factors, such as study time, extracurricular activities, sleep hours, sample question paper practiced and previous grades, to predict students' future academic outcomes.
# The project includes:
Data Processing: Cleaning and preprocessing of student data to ensure model accuracy.
Feature Engineering: Selection of relevant features that impact performance.
Model Building: Implementation of multiple linear regression to predict student scores.
Evaluation: Model evaluation using metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error to measure prediction accuracy.

Used the streamlit app to run the model.

To run the app
Use Streamlit run app.py in terminal.
